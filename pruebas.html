  <h2 class="legalTitle-h2">Our vulnerability disclosure policy</h2>
  Escala is an all-in-one platform to optimize your marketing and sales where you can build powerful sales funnels that generate quality leads and convert them into loyal clients with all the tools you need integrated in one place. As we process personal and sensitive data, security and trust is always at the top of our priorities so we are always working to improve our product in a way that is as secure as possible. But even with everything that Escala is doing, we remain down-to-earth and acknowledge that a vulnerability can always slip through the cracks. Our Vulnerability Disclosure Policy is one of the ways we uncover potential vulnerabilities. We do this by inviting ethical hackers and security researchers to disclose them. If you find a vulnerability, please let us know so that we can take measures as quickly as possible.
