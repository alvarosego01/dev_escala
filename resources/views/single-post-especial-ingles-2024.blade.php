                            Miami, June 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ – <a target="_blank" href="http://escala.com">Escala,</a> the innovative all-in-one CRM

                            strategic support, announced today that it has completed a $12 million funding round co-led, on this latest stage of financing, by <a target="_blank" href="https://igniaunlocked.mx/"> IGNIA </a>
                            and <a target="_blank" href="https://alaya-capital.com/">Alaya Capital,</a> with participation from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.highalpha.com/">High Alpha</a> among other important investors. This substantial capital injection will allow

                        <p>
                            Escala solves the critical marketing and sales challenges that small and medium-sized businesses
                            (SMBs) face when trying to grow. According to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
                            (ECLAC), only 20% of SMBs in Latin America use digital tools in their sales and marketing processes.
                            The lack of digitization hinders the ability to scale and grow their businesses efficiently. Escala aims
                            to transform these figures by simplifying the adoption of proven technologies and methodologies to drive
                            sustainable growth for businesses in the region. With affordable access to this platform and exceptionally
                            easy-to-use tools, complemented by personalized support from Customer Success Managers who guide and train
                            each client, Escala enables businesses to accelerate sales by digitizing and optimizing their sales funnels.
                            Thanks to this comprehensive approach, companies have reported doubling their revenue, generating 300% more leads
                            , and increasing their operational efficiency by 70% in just 6 months of using Escala.
